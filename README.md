# Klapa 
Klapa is a student project that I did with my partner, Ilija Pavlovic. 

The project itself is a solution for creating and editing documents using textual and graphic elements.

It served as an effective way of learning and implementing different OOP principles and design patterns (such as Commander pattern, Factory pattern, State Pattern, Observer pattern, Singleton pattern and MVC+O architecture). It is written using Java with support of Java Swing library.
