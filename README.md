# Klapa 
Klapa is a student project that I did with my partner, Ilija Pavlovic. 

The goal of the project was to learn and implement different OOP principles and design patterns (such as Commander pattern, Factory pattern, State Pattern, Observer pattern, Singleton pattern and MVC+O architecture). It is written using Java and Java Swing.

The project itself is a solution for creating and editing documents using textual and graphic elements.
